## 1. Foundation of Big Data
The article discusses the concept of Big Data, which refers to the vast amounts of dynamic, large, and disparate data being generated by people, tools, and machines in the digital world. The increasing number of internet-connected devices that we interact with on a daily basis record vast amounts of data about us, which requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process this data in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value.

The article explains that Big Data is characterized by the "V's" of velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value. Velocity refers to the speed at which data accumulates, volume refers to the scale of the data or the increase in the amount of data stored, variety refers to the diversity of the data, veracity refers to the quality and origin of data, and its conformity to facts and accuracy, and value refers to our ability and need to turn data into value.

The article provides examples of the V's in action, such as the hours of footage uploaded to YouTube every minute, the approximately 2.5 quintillion bytes of data generated by digital devices every day, and the different types of data that exist, including text, pictures, film, sound, health data from wearable devices, and many different types of data from devices connected to the Internet of Things.

The article also notes that data scientists today derive insights from Big Data and cope with the challenges that these massive data sets present. The scale of the data being collected means that itâ€™s not feasible to use conventional data analysis tools, but alternative tools such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, and its ecosystem provide ways to extract, load, analyze, and process the data across distributed compute resources, providing new insights and knowledge.

In conclusion, the article highlights the importance of Big Data in the digital world and how it can provide new insights and knowledge to organizations that leverage it effectively.
## 2. What is Hadoop?
The video discusses various aspects of data science, including the origins of big data and how it is processed. It explains that big data is characterized by its velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value, and how it can be sliced into pieces and distributed to thousands of computers in a cluster, which then run a program on each piece of the file and send the results back. The results are sorted and redistributed back to another process, with the mapper process being the first and the reduce process being the second.

The video also explains how machine learning is now being applied to large datasets to find patterns that may generate hypotheses, which traditional statisticians may find bothersome. The combination of traditional techniques in computer science, probability, statistics, and mathematics has led to the development of decision sciences, which combines these different areas to make data-driven decisions.

The video highlights that data science and business analytics are still evolving and growing, with new technologies like deep learning and neural networks rapidly expanding and being used by major companies like Google and Facebook. The term "data science" is relatively new, having only become popular in the last five years, and faculty and researchers are still trying to get their hands around exactly what it is and how it can be applied.
## 3. How Big Data is Driving Digital Transformation
Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of an organization, leading to fundamental changes in how it operates and delivers value to customers. It is a cultural and organizational change that is driven by data science, particularly Big Data. The availability of vast amounts of data and the competitive advantage that analyzing it brings has triggered digital transformations across many industries.

Big Data can trigger a digital transformation not just in one organization but in an entire industry. The Houston Rockets NBA team, for example, used Big Data to raise their game by analyzing video tracking data to investigate which plays provided the best opportunities for high scores. This discovery entirely changed the way the team approached each game, increasing the number of three-point shots attempted, and resulting in the team making more three-point shots than any other team in NBA history.

Digital transformation is not simply duplicating existing processes in digital form. It requires in-depth analysis of how the business operates, discovering how to improve processes and operations, and harnessing the benefits of integrating data science into workflows. It impacts every aspect of the organization and requires the support of decision-makers at the top levels, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Data Officer, as well as executives who control budgets, personnel decisions, and day-to-day priorities.

Digital transformation requires a new mindset, but it is the way to succeed in the current and future business landscape. Organizations must realize that digital transformation will require fundamental changes to their approach towards data, employees, and customers, and it will affect their organizational culture. Therefore, it is a whole organization process that requires the support of everyone to succeed.
## 4. Data Science Skills & Big Data
Norman White is a Clinical Faculty Member in the IOMS Department at Stern. He has been interested in technology since his undergraduate degree in Applied Physics and decided to learn how to program while at NYU Business School. He eventually became the director of the computer center while getting his PhD in Economics and Statistics at Stern.

White is currently the Faculty Director of the Stern Center for Research Computing, which provides a private cloud for faculty and PhD students who need specialized hardware and software. He helps configure machines and advises on their use. Many data scientists at Stern use their facilities, as do PhD students.

White teaches several classes on Mondays, including design and development of web-based systems and big data. His big data class is taught using Jupyter notebooks and every student has their own virtual machine on Amazon Web Services. He assigns weekly homework and puts students in teams to work on a big project at the end of the term.
## 5. Data Scientists at New York University
Norman White, a Clinical Faculty Member at NYU Stern School of Business, explains that data science and business analytics have become hot subjects in recent years due to new tools, approaches, and vast amounts of data that traditional techniques cannot handle. He notes that the word is out and more companies are using big data clusters to grind data using data science techniques. White defines big data as data that is large enough and has enough volume and velocity that traditional database systems cannot handle it. He believes that big data was started by Google when they developed an approach to store all web pages in the world to solve their page rank algorithm. White also highlights that big data has expanded into new analytical and statistical techniques for handling large datasets. He concludes by mentioning that big data has prompted the need for new skills and STEM classes in high school to prepare students for careers in data science and analytics.
