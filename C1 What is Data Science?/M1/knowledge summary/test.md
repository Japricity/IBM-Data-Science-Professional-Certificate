## A day in the Life of a Data Scientist
The speaker has experience building a recommendation engine for a large organization, which ended up being a simple solution that was efficient. They also worked on predicting algae blooms using artificial neural networks, helping water treatment companies better handle the problem. They were approached by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) to help analyze their half a million complaints data, which included both structured and unstructured data. After analyzing the data, the speaker couldn't find a pattern for why complaints were higher on certain days. However, after experiencing unexpected rain and stepping in a puddle, they realized that extreme weather might be related to the type of complaints TTC receives. The speaker then used data on rain and precipitation, wind, and light from Environment Canada's website to find that the 10 most excessive days for complaints were those with bad weather. They informed TTC's executives of this finding, but unfortunately, there was nothing they could do to prevent people from complaining on those days.

## Old problems, new problems, Data Science solutions
The article discusses three examples of how data science has been used to provide innovative solutions to old problems. In the first example, Uber uses real-time user data to optimize the number of drivers available in the right place, at the right time, for an acceptable cost to the rider. The second example focuses on the Toronto Transportation Commission, which has used data science tools and analysis to identify areas for interventions, analyze customer complaints data, and use probe data to better understand traffic performance on main routes. By identifying the most congested routes and focusing on peak hour clearances, monthly hours lost for commuters due to traffic congestion dropped significantly. In the third example, a team of scientists from research centers across the US is using high-tech tools to explore cyanobacteria in lakes, collecting large volumes of data related to the lakes and the development of harmful blooms. The information collected will lead to better predictions of when and where cyanobacterial blooms take place, enabling proactive approaches to protect public health in recreational lakes and those that supply drinking water. The article suggests that organizations must identify the problem, gather data, develop a data strategy, and use machine learning models to find efficient and effective solutions to problems. Overall, data science provides organizations with the opportunity to leverage the almost unlimited amount of data available to them in a growing number of ways, ultimately to discover optimum solutions to existing problems.

## Data Science Topics and Algorithms
In this passage, the speaker shares their love for various concepts in data science. They express a particular fondness for regression and data visualization, as well as artificial neural networks. They also mention nearest neighbor as a simple but effective algorithm for obtaining accurate results.

The speaker explains the difference between structured and unstructured data, noting that structured data is easier to analyze as it is formatted like a table with rows and columns, whereas unstructured data comes from sources like the web and may require more sophisticated algorithms to extract information from.

To explain regression, the speaker offers a relatable analogy using a taxi ride as an example. They describe how the base fare is a constant, while the fare for distance and time are variable and calculated through a relationship. Regression allows us to compute the constant and the relationship between distance/time and fare.

Overall, the speaker provides a simplified and relatable explanation of regression while expressing their enthusiasm for various concepts in data science.
