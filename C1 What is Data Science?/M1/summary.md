# Defining Data Science and What Data Scientists Do
## 1. What is Data Science?
Data science is the process of using data to gain insight and understanding of the world around us. It involves translating data into a story and using that story to make strategic choices for companies or institutions. Data science is about processes and systems that extract data from various forms of unstructured or structured data. It is a study of data, with real properties that need to be studied if we are to work on them. Data science involves working with data, finding answers to questions and exploring them. The exercise of analyzing data, manipulating it, and trying to find answers is data science. The tools to work with data are now cheap, available, and ubiquitous. With the availability of data and the ability to store and analyze it, there has never been a better time to be a data scientist.
## 2. Fundamentals of Data Science
Data Science is a field that focuses on data analysis to uncover hidden insights and trends. The availability of vast amounts of data from various sources and the computing power to analyze it have made data science more relevant than ever. Data scientists investigate data to add value to the business by solving specific problems or discovering opportunities. The data science process begins with clarifying the business need and defining the question that the organization wants to answer. The next step is to determine the data needed to solve the problem and where it will come from. Data scientists can analyze structured and unstructured data from various sources and use multiple models to explore the data to reveal patterns and outliers. Once the data has revealed its insights, the role of the data scientist becomes that of a storyteller, communicating the results to stakeholders using powerful data visualization tools. Data Science is changing the way we work with data, helping organizations to understand their environments and analyze existing issues, leading to new approaches and opportunities.
## 3. The Many Paths to Data Science
The concept of data science did not exist when many of the individuals in the video were growing up. The term "data science" was only coined in the late 2000s by individuals such as DJ Patil and Andrew Gelman. Prior to this, the field was known as statistics. Many of the individuals did not start off wanting to be in data science but were drawn to it due to their interests in mathematics, business, or engineering. They were introduced to data science through their work in different fields such as mechanical engineering, project development, transportation research, and retail manufacturing analysis. Some of the individuals studied statistics or business analytics, while others had degrees in fields such as civil engineering, math, or politics, philosophy, and economics. They all ended up working with data and became data scientists through their work in jobs that involved data science, building large data models, analyzing data sets, and using data to make decisions. Overall, data science is a relatively new field, but it has become an increasingly important area of study due to the vast amount of data available today and the potential for data to reveal insights and trends that were previously hidden.
## 4. Advice for New Data Scientists
In this video, the speaker provides advice for aspiring data scientists. They emphasize the importance of curiosity, being argumentative, and judgmental. The ability to take a strong position and modify hypotheses based on data is crucial in data science. The speaker also mentions that comfort and flexibility with analytics platforms are necessary but secondary. The most critical skill for a data scientist is the ability to tell a story and communicate findings effectively.

The speaker suggests that aspiring data scientists first figure out their competitive advantage and interests before acquiring analytical skills. They recommend learning specific tools and platforms relevant to the industry of interest and applying the skills to real-world problems. The video ends with the speaker emphasizing the importance of being able to tell a great story from data findings and showcasing one's abilities to the world.
# What Do Data Scientists Do?
## 5. A day in the Life of a Data Scientist
The speaker has experience building a recommendation engine for a large organization, which ended up being a simple solution that was efficient. They also worked on predicting algae blooms using artificial neural networks, helping water treatment companies better handle the problem. They were approached by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) to help analyze their half a million complaints data, which included both structured and unstructured data. After analyzing the data, the speaker couldn't find a pattern for why complaints were higher on certain days. However, after experiencing unexpected rain and stepping in a puddle, they realized that extreme weather might be related to the type of complaints TTC receives. The speaker then used data on rain and precipitation, wind, and light from Environment Canada's website to find that the 10 most excessive days for complaints were those with bad weather. They informed TTC's executives of this finding, but unfortunately, there was nothing they could do to prevent people from complaining on those days.

## 6. Old problems, new problems, Data Science solutions
The article discusses three examples of how data science has been used to provide innovative solutions to old problems. In the first example, Uber uses real-time user data to optimize the number of drivers available in the right place, at the right time, for an acceptable cost to the rider. The second example focuses on the Toronto Transportation Commission, which has used data science tools and analysis to identify areas for interventions, analyze customer complaints data, and use probe data to better understand traffic performance on main routes. By identifying the most congested routes and focusing on peak hour clearances, monthly hours lost for commuters due to traffic congestion dropped significantly. In the third example, a team of scientists from research centers across the US is using high-tech tools to explore cyanobacteria in lakes, collecting large volumes of data related to the lakes and the development of harmful blooms. The information collected will lead to better predictions of when and where cyanobacterial blooms take place, enabling proactive approaches to protect public health in recreational lakes and those that supply drinking water. The article suggests that organizations must identify the problem, gather data, develop a data strategy, and use machine learning models to find efficient and effective solutions to problems. Overall, data science provides organizations with the opportunity to leverage the almost unlimited amount of data available to them in a growing number of ways, ultimately to discover optimum solutions to existing problems.

## 7. Data Science Topics and Algorithms
In this passage, the speaker shares their love for various concepts in data science. They express a particular fondness for regression and data visualization, as well as artificial neural networks. They also mention nearest neighbor as a simple but effective algorithm for obtaining accurate results.

The speaker explains the difference between structured and unstructured data, noting that structured data is easier to analyze as it is formatted like a table with rows and columns, whereas unstructured data comes from sources like the web and may require more sophisticated algorithms to extract information from.

To explain regression, the speaker offers a relatable analogy using a taxi ride as an example. They describe how the base fare is a constant, while the fare for distance and time are variable and calculated through a relationship. Regression allows us to compute the constant and the relationship between distance/time and fare.

Overall, the speaker provides a simplified and relatable explanation of regression while expressing their enthusiasm for various concepts in data science.
## 8. Cloud for Data Science
The article discusses how cloud computing has revolutionized data science by providing a central storage system and advanced computing algorithms that bypass the physical limitations of computers and systems. Cloud allows data scientists to store large amounts of data and deploy advanced computing algorithms, even if they don't have access to advanced machines or their own computing environment.

One of the key advantages of cloud computing is that it allows multiple entities to work with the same data simultaneously, regardless of their location. The centralization of information, algorithms, tools, and answers in the cloud makes it easier for collaborators in different locations to work together on producing a solution.

Cloud-based technologies are accessible from everywhere and can be used from laptops, tablets, and even phones, making collaboration easier than ever before. The article also notes that big tech companies like IBM, Amazon, and Google offer cloud platforms that allow data scientists to become familiar with cloud-based technologies in a pre-built environment.

Using the cloud for data science allows for instant access to open-source technologies like Apache Spark, without the need to install and configure them locally. Cloud computing also provides access to the most up-to-date tools and libraries without worrying about maintaining them and ensuring that they are up-to-date.

In summary, cloud computing is a godsend for data scientists, as it provides a central storage system and advanced computing algorithms that bypass the physical limitations of computers and systems. It allows multiple entities to work with the same data simultaneously, regardless of their location, and it provides instant access to open-source technologies and up-to-date tools and libraries.
