Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.

There are  many paths to a career in data science; most, but not all, involve a little math, a little science, and a lot of curiosity about data.

New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.

Why data science is considered the sexiest job in the 21st century, paying high salaries for skilled workers.

The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.

Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data. 

Accessing algorithms, tools, and data through the Cloud enables Data Scientists to stay up-to-date and collaborate easily.


## 1. A day in the Life of a Data Scientist
The speaker has experience building a recommendation engine for a large organization, which ended up being a simple solution that was efficient. They also worked on predicting algae blooms using artificial neural networks, helping water treatment companies better handle the problem. They were approached by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) to help analyze their half a million complaints data, which included both structured and unstructured data. After analyzing the data, the speaker couldn't find a pattern for why complaints were higher on certain days. However, after experiencing unexpected rain and stepping in a puddle, they realized that extreme weather might be related to the type of complaints TTC receives. The speaker then used data on rain and precipitation, wind, and light from Environment Canada's website to find that the 10 most excessive days for complaints were those with bad weather. They informed TTC's executives of this finding, but unfortunately, there was nothing they could do to prevent people from complaining on those days.

## 2. Old problems, new problems, Data Science solutions
The article discusses three examples of how data science has been used to provide innovative solutions to old problems. In the first example, Uber uses real-time user data to optimize the number of drivers available in the right place, at the right time, for an acceptable cost to the rider. The second example focuses on the Toronto Transportation Commission, which has used data science tools and analysis to identify areas for interventions, analyze customer complaints data, and use probe data to better understand traffic performance on main routes. By identifying the most congested routes and focusing on peak hour clearances, monthly hours lost for commuters due to traffic congestion dropped significantly. In the third example, a team of scientists from research centers across the US is using high-tech tools to explore cyanobacteria in lakes, collecting large volumes of data related to the lakes and the development of harmful blooms. The information collected will lead to better predictions of when and where cyanobacterial blooms take place, enabling proactive approaches to protect public health in recreational lakes and those that supply drinking water. The article suggests that organizations must identify the problem, gather data, develop a data strategy, and use machine learning models to find efficient and effective solutions to problems. Overall, data science provides organizations with the opportunity to leverage the almost unlimited amount of data available to them in a growing number of ways, ultimately to discover optimum solutions to existing problems.

## Data Science Topics and Algorithms
In this passage, the speaker shares their love for various concepts in data science. They express a particular fondness for regression and data visualization, as well as artificial neural networks. They also mention nearest neighbor as a simple but effective algorithm for obtaining accurate results.

The speaker explains the difference between structured and unstructured data, noting that structured data is easier to analyze as it is formatted like a table with rows and columns, whereas unstructured data comes from sources like the web and may require more sophisticated algorithms to extract information from.

To explain regression, the speaker offers a relatable analogy using a taxi ride as an example. They describe how the base fare is a constant, while the fare for distance and time are variable and calculated through a relationship. Regression allows us to compute the constant and the relationship between distance/time and fare.

Overall, the speaker provides a simplified and relatable explanation of regression while expressing their enthusiasm for various concepts in data science.
## 3. Cloud for Data Science
The article discusses how cloud computing has revolutionized data science by providing a central storage system and advanced computing algorithms that bypass the physical limitations of computers and systems. Cloud allows data scientists to store large amounts of data and deploy advanced computing algorithms, even if they don't have access to advanced machines or their own computing environment.

One of the key advantages of cloud computing is that it allows multiple entities to work with the same data simultaneously, regardless of their location. The centralization of information, algorithms, tools, and answers in the cloud makes it easier for collaborators in different locations to work together on producing a solution.

Cloud-based technologies are accessible from everywhere and can be used from laptops, tablets, and even phones, making collaboration easier than ever before. The article also notes that big tech companies like IBM, Amazon, and Google offer cloud platforms that allow data scientists to become familiar with cloud-based technologies in a pre-built environment.

Using the cloud for data science allows for instant access to open-source technologies like Apache Spark, without the need to install and configure them locally. Cloud computing also provides access to the most up-to-date tools and libraries without worrying about maintaining them and ensuring that they are up-to-date.

In summary, cloud computing is a godsend for data scientists, as it provides a central storage system and advanced computing algorithms that bypass the physical limitations of computers and systems. It allows multiple entities to work with the same data simultaneously, regardless of their location, and it provides instant access to open-source technologies and up-to-date tools and libraries.
